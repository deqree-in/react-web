        Deqree was founded on the belief that vital records should be able to be
        managed in a secure tamper-proof manner and should be easily verifiable.
        We started from the ground zero, rethinking how records were produced in
        India, how they could be made tamper-proof, and how they could be
        validated quickly and from anywhere free of cost while ensuring the
        privacy. We don't only want to make a platform where users can verify
        credentials; we also wanted to make the procedure as easy as possible so
        that universities, students and recruiters can use our tamper-proof
        digital documentation with a single click. We also plan to deploy
        smart-contracts for usecases under special circumstances with the help
        of a next generation peer-reviewed Blockchain (Cardano).
